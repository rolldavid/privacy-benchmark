# Request a swap quote

> Generates a swap quote based on input parameters such as the assets, amount, slippage tolerance, and recipient/refund information.

Returns pricing details, estimated time, and a unique **deposit address** to which tokens must be transferred to initiate the swap.

You can set the `dry` parameter to `true` to simulate the quote request **without generating a deposit address** or initiating the swap process. This is useful for previewing swap parameters or validating input data without committing to an actual swap.

This endpoint is the first required step in the swap process.

            How to interpret `amount` (and refunds) when performing the swap:


            - `EXACT_INPUT` — requests the output amount for an exact input.
              - If deposit is less than `amountIn`, the deposit is refunded by deadline.
              - If deposit is above than `amountIn`, the swap is processed and the excess is refunded to `refundTo` address after swap is complete.

            - `EXACT_OUTPUT` — requests the input amount for an exact output.
              - The output amount (`amountOut`) is fixed; slippage is applied to the **input** side.
              - The quote response includes `amountIn` (the proposed input with slippage tolerance baked in) and `minAmountIn` (the minimum input required).
              - **Important**: `amountIn` will appear higher than `minAmountIn` by approximately your `slippageTolerance`. This is **not** price degradation—it is a buffer to ensure successful execution. Any input amount above what is actually needed for the swap is **refunded** to your `refundTo` address after the swap completes.
              - If the deposit is above `amountIn`, the swap is processed and the excess is refunded to `refundTo` address after swap is complete.
              - If the deposit is less than `minAmountIn`, the deposit is refunded by deadline.

            - `FLEX_INPUT` — a flexible input amount that allows for partial
            deposits and variable amounts.
              - `slippage` applies both to `amountOut` and `amountIn` and defines an acceptable range (`minAmountIn` and `minAmountOut`).
              - Any amount higher than `minAmountIn` is accepted and converted to the output asset as long as `minAmountOut` is met.
              - The deposit must be at least `minAmountIn`, after applying the slippage constraint to the quoted amount. Deposits below `minAmountIn` are refunded if the total received by the deadline is below this amount.
              - If deposits exceed the upper bound, the swap is still processed

            - `ANY_INPUT` — collects deposits and converts them to a destination
            asset. Used for fee aggregation and similar use cases. Only
            available for authorized partners.
          enum:
            - EXACT_INPUT

# Risk & Compliance

> How NEAR Intents implements compliance screening and financial integrity measures

At NEAR Intents, we are deeply committed to implementing best practices in compliance and financial integrity. Transparency, accountability, and adherence to international standards are not just regulatory requirements for us they are guiding principles.

Our goal is to ensure that all transactions routed through NEAR Intents are secure, transparent, and fully aligned with global efforts to combat money laundering, sanctions violations, and other forms of financial crime.

For platform security posture and incident controls, see [Proactive Intents Security](/security-compliance/proactive-intents-security).

## Law Enforcement Requests

For any formal request, law enforcement authorities are required to submit the request and supporting documentation through our designated portal:

## Current Implementation

### Real-time compliance screening

NEAR Intents applies automated compliance screening on integrated quote flows against multiple trusted data sources:

  <Card title="Binance AML" icon="building">

  </Card>

  <Card title="TRM Labs" icon="chart-network" href="https://www.trmlabs.com/">
    Enhanced screening for non-dry quotes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These checks identify overlap between addresses in the request and addresses flagged in external databases.

<Info>
  Coverage can vary by flow and integration path. The compliance and Shield stack is expanding toward broader, end-to-end enforcement across additional surfaces.
